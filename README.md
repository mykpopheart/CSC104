The website I created is called Kpop Fan Chants.  For the website I created a headline that reads "Welcome to K-Pop Fan Chants!" and a 2nd headline that reads "Your go-to source for all K-Pop fan chants.  I have included some text about the page in the main body of the page.  The alphabetical letters on the left side of the page are links that when clicked will take the user to a fan chant.  Each link coinsides with a K-Pop group, for example to access fan chants for the K-Pop female group ITZY, the user would click on the letter "I".  To find fan chants for the female K-Pop group 2NE1, the user would click "number".  I have also included a "request fan chant" button that when clickd will direct the user to a form to submit a request for a fan chant that they would like to see.  All links currently navigate to an example page.  The background is my personal drawing that I created.
