#CSC104 W4 
W4 Final Project: HTML README
The website I created is called Kpop Fan Chants.  For the website I created a headline that reads "Welcome to K-Pop Fan Chants!" and a 2nd headline that reads "Your go-to source for all K-Pop fan chants.  I have included some text about the page in the main body of the page.  The alphabetical letters on the left side of the page are links that when clicked will take the user to the fan chant listing.  Each link coinsides with a K-Pop group, for example to access fan chants for the K-Pop female group ITZY, the user would click on the letter "I".  To find fan chants for the female K-Pop group 2NE1, the user would click "number".  I have also included a "request fan chant" button that when the user hovers the background color changes and when clicked will direct the user to a form to submit a request for a fan chant that they would like to see. I am not sure how to create a form so for now there is no form. The user would only see a statement about submitting a form request. The link for the first letter "A" navigates to a dummy page where the user would see a listing of Kpop groups or soloist. Nothing happens right now when the links are clicked but I woud like to have a box or something open up displaying some songs of the group and when a song is clicked the fan chant will display.
